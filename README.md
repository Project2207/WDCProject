Interacting with the website:
Unsuccessful AJAX calls will result in the Vue components not loading
* To see how users would interact with pages:
* Uncomment the script tag that use the Dummy Data, and comment the script tag that uses the Database Data

For example in user_edit_plan_organiser.html:
* Uncomment line 11
* Recomment line 13

The html files that have dummy data linked are:
* user_edit_plan_organiser.html
* attendee_guest_plan.html
* attendee_user_plan.html
* attendee_view_event.html
